### Site Goals

The goal of the site is to allow visitors to read reviews created by registered users and to find inspiration for self-help books that they can read by topic. 
The features of the website include: 
-	Show a list of concise book reviews available to all site visitors. 
-	Provide links to the associated books reviewed (non-affiliated links for demonstration purposes only)
-	Allow visitors to register an account in order to create their own reviews on this website for the benefit of other users. 

This is achieved by: 
-	Having a registration form with username and password in order to create an account. 
-	Having a login page for existing users to access their account. 
-	Allowing users to create and edit their own books reviews when logged in. 
-	Having an Admin account which allows a superuser to also add or edit new genres. (New: “and add affiliate links to the book reviews.”)

#### Design Features 

Font
I chose Barlow sans-serif for a clean look and feel like the body of a modern non-fiction or text book. 
Colour scheme selection:

My responses were geared toward my target audience who are professionals seeking clear guidance which provides certainty in their career and personal growth decisions. 

“Blue is a trusting and secure colour, conjuring up the feeling of calm and even spirituality. 
It's often used in corporate designs and is well-known as a favourite colour. Blue is loyal, dependable, 
and it's a great colour to use if you want your customers to trust you. 
Blue is also appealing to shoppers on a budget. It's the most widely-used color for company logos. 
Be careful, as some shades of blue can be perceived as depressing and cold.” (Source: grasshopper.com) 

To get the right shade of blue I used the colour wheel to find a suitable blue shade that contrasted well with the brown tint of my bookstore image 
which I obtained from Canva’s colour wheel:
